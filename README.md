Steps:
1) Download the image from http://intro-webdesign.com/CSS/assignment-2/images/flywheel.jpg and put it into a folder named images.

2) Style the following:

The body should have padding and margin

The header should have a background color, background image (using a local image), and padding

The navigation links (and only the links in the navigation) should be styled with a new display, margin, border-radius, text-decoration, and padding

The link to the current page should be styled differently from the other links (using class = "active')

The sections should be next to each other, not one on top of the other.

The images should be part of the page now. In addition, they should have a border, be centered horizontally, and have vertical (top/bottom) space between them and the other images.

3) The table should be styled using at least four properties

4) The table headings should have a border, background color, and at least one other property.

5) Style the table so that the text in the first column is left-aligned and the text in the other two columns is centered

6) Set the opacity of the table rows to a value between .6 and .8 (make sure it is still visible)

7) Change the opacity of a row when it is hovered over

8) The table elements < td > should be styled using at least four properties
